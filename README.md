FORGEX by TEAM ETHIX

~ ForgeX is inspired by the word "Forge", which means to shape, create, or develop something strong and valuable.

Our Website ForgeX is a solution for the current system that faces several challenges: manufacturing orders, stock management, and BOMs (Bill of Materials) are fragmented, leading to inefficiencies. There is limited visibility into production stages and work order progress, and no dynamic dashboard or filtering to quickly track order status. Additionally, stock, production, and reporting are poorly integrated, while reliance on manual paperwork for BOMs, stock ledgers, and reports makes the process error-prone and unreliable.

ForgeX aims to allow businesses to create, track and manage there end to end production process digitally.
